## How Can I Contribute?

### Report a bug

If you think you have found a bug in this tool, we'd love your help identifying and fixing it. To do so, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search the issue list:** Check to see if anyone has reported a similar issue. If so, comment on that issue with additional details or context.
1. **Use the issue template** If no one else has reported it yet, please submit a new issue and select the `Bug Report` template. This is populated with the following sections:
    - **Overview:** Succinctly describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior
    - **Steps to Reproduce:** Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you got to the page where you encountered the bug.
    - **Expected Behavior:** Explain which behavior you expected to see instead, why, and how the behavior you saw failed to meet that expectation.
    - **Screenshots:** Include screenshots and animated GIFs if possible, which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
    - **Your Environment:** List the technical details about your computer and/or development environment.
1. **Check the Bug Tracker:** Check the status of your bug by referencing the Bug Tracker project board on the project tab.

### Request new functionality

If you don't have specific language or code to submit but would like to suggest a change, request a feature,
or have something addressed, we'd love to get your feedback. To request new functionality, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Search the issue list:** Check the list of existing issues to see if anyone has requested a similar feature or functionality. If so, feel free to comment on that issue with more context or details.
1. **Use the issue template** If no one else has requested something similar, please submit a new issue and select the `Feature Request` template. This is populated with the following sections:
    - **Feature Overview:** Brief description of the feature you want added to this tool. Along with some details about how it should function and whether it's related to a specific problem you're encountering.
    - **Alternatives Considered:** What other options might exist to achieve the same functionality with the existing tool. Why aren't those workarounds sufficient.
    - **Additional Context:** Anything else we should know about this request?
1. **Check the Feature Roadmap:** Check the status of your request by referencing the Feature Roadmap project board on the project tab.

> **NOTE:** Not all feature requests will be implemented. The project maintainers will review each feature request and consider scoping it into the roadmap or explaining why the feature won't be implemented.

### Contribute to the codebase

If you've implemented a new feature, fixed a bug, or made some documentation clearer, we'd love to consider your contribution to this tool. In order to submit a contribution, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repo:** Create a copy of this repo where you can make your proposed changes by [following the Github forking methodology](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
1. **Find or create an issue:** Before proposing a change, make sure there is a corresponding issue (i.e. Bug Fix, Task, Feature Request) that describes the contribution you'll be making. If there isn't an existing issue, create a new one by selecting and filling out a template from the issue tab.
1. **Create a feature branch:** Create a feature branch on your forked repository with a descriptive name, ideally one that references the issue number that your contribution is related to (e.g., `issue-10-unit-testing`).
1. **Make changes and test them:** Add your code or documentation and commit those changes to the feature branch. If your contribution includes code, make sure you've written tests for it and that all of the tests are passing.
1. **Submit a pull request** When you're ready to make your contribution, [submit a pull request against the upstream repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and fill out the PR template sections so that project maintainers can begin to review your contributions.
1. **Fix requested changes:** As maintainers review your proposed contribution, they may request specific changes. If so, simply add and commit those changes to the feature branch directly and they'll automatically show up on the PR.
1. **Celebrate:** Once all of the requested changes are made, your commits will be merged into the `main` branch. Time to give yourself a hand because you just added to this project!!!
